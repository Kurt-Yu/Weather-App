# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built with `node.js`, I made it mainly to learn about node.js development.

The APIs I used including [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) (given a latitude and longitude, return weather information of that location) and [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/) (given a location name, return laitude and longotude).
